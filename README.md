# NBAPlayersKnowledgeBasedSystem
A Knowledge Based System that infers the player based on answers to questions. For instance an answer to the question "Is the player a guard" will filter out all non-guard players from our list of players. Based on further answers to questions the system will infer which player you are talking about as well as infer properties of the player such as team played for, teammates, awards, allocades, etc.
